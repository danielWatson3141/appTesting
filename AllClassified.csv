Animations/visuals/styles,Image 'contain' resizeMode not working in react native,36436913,15101,I am using React Native on a real Android device When creating a really simple app with just the following render function on the main app component I get the following result on my device As you can see the whole background is yellow so that tells us the image element is taking the whole screen size indeed But it is just rendered wrong The cover resizeMode does work as expected and so does the stretch mode It is the contain mode that is not working the most important one from my point of view The problem gets even worse when placing the image on a ListView since the image does not even show UPDATE 1 As Frederick points out contain only works when the image is larger than the container size So how can we make the image take the whole container size while keeping its aspect ratio? Percentages are not supported yet by styles in React and I don t know how to get the image width and height properties once the image is loaded None of the events associated with the Image component provide that info UPDATE 2 Good news I am now using React Native v0 24 1 and it seems the image contain mode now works as expected even when the actual image size is smaller than its container zvona s solution is good although you need to bear in mind that onLayout will give you the image view size the image is rendered in but NOT the actual image size being loaded As for now I don t know of any way to find out the actual image size let s suppose you are retrieving the image from a network resource and you don t know the size which could be very important if you want to calculate its aspect ratio

How to access object from within method called as callback?,35534818,11359,I m trying to wrap my head around the syntax for Classes in ES6 While at the same time learning Fabric native through Bonnie Eisenman s Learning React Native I ve come accross an issue around accessing in a callback when that callback is a Class method I m aware issues around lexical in callbacks have been raised many times on StackOverflow For instance in How to access the correct this context inside a callback? Based on my research online I ve come across a solution But I am not sure this is the correct way to do it in ES6 My issue came about when I tried the following below Which I ve only slightly modified from the example in the book to match the ES6 class syntax and the import export syntax instead of Require If I do this the in is undefined cannot read property setState of undefined I was surprised by this Coming from other OO languages I m interpreting as though this method is behaving more as if it was a static method I ve been able to solve this by skipping the class method and using the arrow notation Which works fine I have no problems or confusion with that I really want to work out how to call a class method though After a fair bit of research I ve managed to make it work by doing the following Perhaps I ve misunderstood a fundamental aspect of JavaScript I m a beginner in JS but this seems completely insane to me Is there really no way of accessing the context of an object from within a method without explicitly binding the object back onto it s own method at the point where it is called? I ve also tried adding in the constructor and calling in But wasn t too surprised to find that didn t work What s the correct way of accessing an object from within one of its methods when it is called as a callback?

How would I even begin to debug this? Is there a way to see what s responding to touches granting and releasing and when?

State,"Why does this error exist: \Invariant Violation: Cannot update during an existing state transition\""""",31420402,8974,I seem to be running into this error in a large application but I m not exactly sure where Uncaught Error Invariant Violation setState Cannot update during an existing state transition such as within Render methods should be a pure function of props and state I suspect it might be the result of using inside of or Which leads me to my real question why does this error exist? Is there some conceptual reason I m missing why ReactJS doesn t just queue state and prop changes? I m guessing if there is a reason it has to do with application complexity and or avoiding race conditions My next question then would be what is the proper way to update a component outside of React during some asynchronous event for example so that this error doesn t occur? Edit After some digging into this issue further it appears the culprit is actually the underlying platform I m using ElectronJS formally Atom Shell Basically ElectronJS combines Chromium and NodeJS together I was using a NodeJS API to do something asynchronous and it appears when that finished ElectronJS would just return back to the call stack where it left off bypassing the event loop altogether and thus causing a race condition with React

Components,react-native component lifecycle methods not firing on navigation,30768595,7922,I am having an issue where I setState in multiple components based on the same key in AsyncStorage Since the state is set in componentDidMount and these components don t necessarily unmount and mount on navigation the state value and the AsyncStorage value can get out of sync Here is the simplest example I could make Component A A just sets up the navigation and app Component B B reads from AsyncStorage on mount and then sets to state Component C C reads the same value from AsyncStorage as B but allows you to change the value Changing toggles both the value in state and in AsyncStorage If you toggle in C and then return to B the state in B and value in AsyncStorage are now out of sync As far as I can tell navigator pop does not trigger any component lifecycle functions I can use to tell B to refresh the value One solution I am aware of but isn t ideal is to make B s state a prop to C and give C a callback prop to toggle it That would work well if B and C would always be directly parent and child but in a real app the navigation hierarchy could be much deeper Is there anyway to trigger a function on a component after a navigation event or something else that I m missing?

State,Correct way to update form states in React?,40499265,98,So I m having a go at my first React app using create react app and I m trying to make a multi stage form based on this GitHub project In particular the AccountFields and Registration parts That project seems to have been written in a much older version of React so I ve had to try and update it and this is what I have so far App js Activity js I ve looked at a number of examples and this seems to be the right approach to store the current state to allow users to go back and forth between different parts of the form and to then store the values from this stage When I click the button I get an error saying I mean obviously this means is null but I m unsure of how to fix it Am I approaching this the wrong way?

External/OS Services,Handling first time users in react-native,48946889,43,Is there any configuration in react navigation for screens I only want to display once during the life time of the app? For instance once the app is installed for the first time I want the help screen to appear If no configuration is available then what is the best way to do it? My idea is to save a variable locally and set it once the help screen has been displayed Once the user opens the app again this variable will be checked and based on the that the next screen will appear The problem here is that if the user erased the app data cache and all then the help screen will appear again even if he is not a first time user Any suggestions? 
FlatList/ListView/ScrollView,Prohibit updating props of already rendered component in ListView,40623460,43,I have a inside a component on which is sometimes called quite soon after scene load and in this set state I pass a new array for data source which I similar to the previous one but prepended with one element So react rerenders the but the problem is that it does this via cascade update of props or rows Here s the illustration I had a list view Here instance ID is some ID of constructed component which I show for reference Now after I prepend the data with object having prop A this happens to the list view As you can see react created new component instance but for last element prop D and previous elements were all updated triggering Instance 1 was given prop A instead of B and so on But here s the problem on construction of row components I immediately run code which synchronizes the component with remote server something like this So this creates a bad situation when fetch from remote server completes this component might have already received new someProp so the fresh data is pushed into wrong component instance Of course I can request fresh data again in but that is too much overhead Is there a way to tell react that my component should not receive new props when already constructed? So that it creates new component before others instead of updating props of all of them Or is there another way to solve my problem?

Redux,Is react-native animation jittery on frequent updates of redux state?,40478075,42,My list view presents a stack of cards that is scrolled horizontally At most three cards are visible in the view with the outer most cards on the left and right fading in and out as a function of the user scrolling horizontally I calculate which cards are suppose to fade in out as the user scrolls utilizing the internal list view API to check and continually update redux state as a result The problem is the scrolling animation experience is inconsistent It jitters when I scroll sometimes and other times it is smooth Sometimes the fade in out functionality bugs out or updates a few seconds later after a scroll What gives? Is jittery animation normally expected when the redux state is updated frequently?

Components,React Native - Child Component won't finish rendering after Child Event called that updates Parent's state,48979059,32,In my project I m looping through cards in my Child Component and updating the Parent s state with ones where I activate an event of swiping right on the card to favorite The parent s state keeps track of all favorites by adding the favorited card to the array I m passing down a function from the Parent Component to the Child that allows the Child to call and append to the array in the Parent state But when I activate the eventhandler inside the Child Component the parent s state gets updated as planned with the new Card but nothing below the in gets rendered automatically for the next card as it should If I tap the screen then the next card picture renders only then Any ideas? Am I missing some binding or need to do some componentDidMount or anything so the code in child component renders even after I activate the event handler that updates the parent state? Basically is there a tool in React to make sure something renders or at least waits for it to render? post event handling which sets the parents state in my case abbreviated Project structure UPDATE more info Just to test the event handler I added in a function that doesn t set the state of the parent and had call that on the event handler it works perfectly and the child component renders perfectly It seems that it s the function passed down from the parent to the child that acts to call upstream that for some reason is causing the Child to not render not finish rendering after the event handler

Firebase/Expo,React Native - Firebase Storage links stored in Database,49102876,23,I have done some small research and found out it might be a good idea to store the links of the files from Firebase Cloud Storage to the Firebase Database In short I would like to implement a user gallery in my app However as a newbie I am not sure what is the best way to approach this For example some of the major questions that occurred to me were How should I call the fields of the links in the Database? Say if they are uniquely generated ids how am I going to extract every single link from the database in React Native?
